description: "The Duchess of Malfi (originally published as The Tragedy of the Dutchesse\
  \ of Malfy) is a macabre, tragic play written by the English dramatist John Webster\
  \ in 1612–13. It was first performed privately at the Blackfriars Theatre, then\
  \ before a more general audience at The Globe, in 1613–14.\nPublished in 1623, the\
  \ play is loosely based on events that occurred between about 1508 and 1513. The\
  \ Duchess was Giovanna d'Aragona, Duchess of Amalfi (d. 1511), whose father, Enrico\
  \ d'Aragona, Marquis of Gerace, was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand I of Naples.\
  \ As in the play, she secretly married Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna after the death\
  \ of her first husband Alfonso I Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi.\nThe play begins as\
  \ a love story, with a Duchess who marries beneath her class, and ends as a nightmarish\
  \ tragedy as her two brothers exact their revenge, destroying themselves in the\
  \ process. Jacobean drama continued the trend of stage violence and horror set by\
  \ Elizabethan tragedy, under the influence of Seneca. The complexity of some of\
  \ its characters, particularly Bosola and the Duchess, plus Webster's poetic language,\
  \ ensure the play is often considered among the greatest tragedies of English renaissance\
  \ drama.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
